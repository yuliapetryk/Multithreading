<b>Multithreaded sorting algorithms</b>

The program supports work with <em>ArrayList</em>. 
 
 <b>5</b> types of sorting are implemented, in particular:

 1) BubbleSort

 2) BitonicSort

 3) MergeSort

 4) InsertionSort

 5) QuickSort

 <b>A multi-threaded parallel version</b> was implemented for such sorts as BitonicSort, MergeSort, QuickSort  

 *In order to compare the results of the work of both versions of the algorithm, time measurement was implemented. All results are added to the file result.txt*
